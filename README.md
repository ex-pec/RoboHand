With this project, we aim to design a robot arm. This robot arm will be controlled wirelessly through a wearable glove. This will be done via a bluetooth connection. Moreover, the use of many circuit elements they use in their own projects for beginners will be shown. Systems can be briefly you out with this project:
•	Arduino use,
•	Use of  bluetooth module,
•	Communication between two Arduinos,
•	Using Servo motor with Flex sensor data.
